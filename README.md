#Nqueens

Description

Nqueens is a program to solve a puzzle of fitting n queens on an n x n chessboard.

The program does the following: 
- Read in user input for the placement of the first Queen
- Implements recursion to see if n-1 queens can be placed on the board
- Prints out the coordinates if the solution are correct, or prints out No Solution if the solutions are incorrect

Instructions

Call the command _java -jar NQueens2.jar_ followed by 3 positive integers
Example:
_java -jar NQueens.jar 7 3 2_

This means we have a 7 x 7 chessboard with one queen placed at (3,2). It will then output the results to solutions.txt
